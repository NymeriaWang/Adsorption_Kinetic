# Adsorption_Kinetic


The software implementation of Adsorption_Kinetic is for analyzing the real problems in:

Yun J, Lin D Q, Yao S J. Predictive modeling of protein adsorption along the bed height by taking into account the axial nonuniform liquid dispersion and particle classification in expanded beds[J]. Journal of Chromatography A, 2005, 1095(1-2): 16-26.

卢慧丽. 层析介质孔径与配基密度对蛋白吸附性能影响及抗体分离研究[D]. 浙江大学, 2014.

The first version was completed on October 26, 2019.

To start with the first version of Adsorption_Kinetic, you can both load data from '.mat' file or input by your self. We provide one example loading data for our first version implementation, called 'example.mat'. You can load it directly.

We keep updating both the software version and wiki.
